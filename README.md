# Fractals
For C++

WORK IN PROGRESS

This code consists of three main components: Mandelbrot Set calculations in both normal precision and unlimited precision, along with Julia Sets, Newton fractals and some custom formulas.
The graphics are rendered using SFML and the program is multithreaded.

Compiled into a .exe file here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/fractal-explorer/
